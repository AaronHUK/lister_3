# Strings and characters
In python, we call a single letter (like 'b') a **character**, and a whole word or sentence (like "Hello Lister!") a **string**.

So strings are actually just lots of characters one after another. When you have a string saved, you can even load individual characters from it! Try this:

```
displayname = input("What's your name?")
